# opencv_getting_started
Simple Tutorial for Using basic OpenCV tools

# Requirements
1. Python (2.7):
  1. Opencv (3.1.0)
  2. numpy (1.13 via pip)
  3. matplotlib (2.0.2)
  4. scipy (0.19.1)
  5. jupyter notebook
  
There are two .ipynb notebooks in this repo:
1. `Getting Started on OpenCV.ipynb`
2. `camera_tools.ipynb`

`Getting Started on OpenCV.ipynb` is a quick run through of some of OpenCV's basic functions. It follows a simple image processing task of determining the shapes of wooden blocks. 

`camera_tools.ipynb` includes some python functions for capturing images, checking camera ports and cropping images.
